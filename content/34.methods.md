## Methods

### Datasets

#### GTEx

We downloaded the 17,382 TPM-normalized samples of bulk RNA-seq expression data available from version 8 of GTEx.
We zero-one standardized the data and retained the 5000 most variable genes.
The tissue labels we used for the GTEx dataset were derived from the 'SMTS' column of the sample metadata file.

#### Recount3

We downloaded RNA-seq data from the Recount3 compendium [@pmc:PMC86284] during the week of March 14, 2022.
Before filtering, the dataset contained 317,258 samples, each containing 63,856 genes.
To filter out single-cell data, we removed all samples with greater than 75 percent sparsity.
We also removed all samples marked 'scrna-seq' by Recount3's pattern matching method (stored in the metadata as 'recount_pred.pattern.predict.type').
We then converted the data to transcripts per kilobase million using gene lengths from BioMart [@pmc:PMC2649164] and performed standardization to scale each gene's range from zero to one.
We kept the 5,000 most variable genes within the dataset.

We labeled samples with their corresponding tissues using the 'recount_pred.curated.tissue' field in the Recount3 metadata.
These labels were based on manual curation by the Recount3 authors.
A total of 20,324 samples in the dataset had corresponding tissue labels.
Samples were also labeled with their corresponding sex using labels from Flynn et al. [@pmc:PMC8011224].
These labels were derived using pattern matching on metadata from the European Nucleotide Archive [@pmc:PMC3013801].
A total of 23,525 samples in our dataset had sex labels.

#### Data simulation

We generated three simulated datasets.
The first dataset contained 1,000 samples of 5,000 features corresponding to two classes.
Of those features, 2,500 contained linear signal.
That is to say that the feature values corresponding to one class were drawn from a standard normal distribution, while the feature values corresponding to the other were drawn from a Gaussian with a mean of 6 and unit variance.

We generated the non-linear features similarly.
The values for the non-linear features were drawn from a standard normal distribution for one class, while the second class had values drawn from either a mean six or negative six Gaussian with equal probability.
These features are referred to as "non-linear" because two dividing lines are necessary to perfectly classify such data, while a linear classifier can only draw one such line per feature.

The second dataset was similar to the first dataset, but it consisted solely of 2,500 linear features.
The final dataset contained only values drawn from a standard normal distribution regardless of class label.

### Model architectures

We used three representative models to demonstrate the performance profiles of different model classes.
The first was a linear model, ridge logistic regression, selected as a simple linear baseline to compare the non-linear models against.
The next model was a three-layer fully-connected neural network with ReLU non-linearities [@https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3104322.3104425] and hidden layers of size 2500 and 1250.
This network served as a model of intermediate complexity: it was capable of learning non-linear decision boundaries, but not the more complex representations a deeper model might learn.
Finally, we built a five-layer neural network to serve as a (somewhat) deep neural net.
This model also used ReLU non-linearities, and had hidden layers of sizes 2500, 2500, 2500, and 1250.
The five-layer network, while not particularly deep compared to, e.g., state of the art computer vision models, was still in the domain where more complex representations could be learned, and vanishing gradients had to be accounted for.

### Model training

We trained our models via a maximum of 50 epochs of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent in PyTorch [@arxiv:1912.01703].
Our models minimized the cross-entropy loss using an Adam [@arxiv:1412.6980] optimizer.
They also used inverse frequency weighting to avoid giving more weight to more common classes.
To regularize the models, we used early stopping and gradient clipping during the training process.
The only training differences between the models were that the two neural nets used dropout [@https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html] with a probability of 0.5, and the deeper network used batch normalization [@https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ioffe15.html] to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

We ensured the results were deterministic by setting the Python, NumPy, and PyTorch random seeds for each run, as well as setting the PyTorch backends to deterministic and disabling the benchmark mode.
The learning rate and weight decay hyperparameters for each model were selected via nested cross-validation over the training folds at runtime, and we tracked and recorded our model training progress using Neptune [@neptune].

We also used Limma[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkv007] to remove linear signal associated with tissues in the data.
We ran the 'removeBatchEffect' function on the training and validation sets separately, using the tissue labels as batch labels.
This function fits a linear model that learns to predict the training data from the batch labels, and uses that model to regress out the linear signal within the training data that is predictive of the batch labels.

### Model Evaluation
In our analyses we used five-fold cross-validation with study-wise data splitting.
In a study-wise split, the studies are randomly assigned to cross-validation folds such that all samples in a given study end up in a single fold (fig. @fig:workflow B).

**Hardware**  
Our analyses were performed on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine and the Colorado Summit compute cluster.
The desktop CPU used was an AMD Ryzen 7 3800xt processor with 16 cores and access to 64 GB of RAM, and the desktop GPU used was an Nvidia RTX 3090.
The Summit cluster used Intel Xeon E5-2680 CPUs and NVidia Tesla K80 GPUs.
From initiating data download to finishing all analyses and generating all figures, the full Snakemake [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480] pipeline took around one month to run.

**Recount3 tissue prediction**  
In the Recount3 setting, the multi-tissue classification analyses were trained on the 21 tissues (see Supp. Methods) that had at least ten studies in the dataset.
Each model was trained to determine which of the 21 tissues a given expression sample corresponded to.

To address class imbalance, our models' performance was then measured based on the balanced accuracy across all classes.
Unlike raw accuracy, balanced accuracy (the mean across all classes of the per-class recall) isn't predominantly determined by performance on the largest class in an imbalanced class setting.
For example, in a binary classification setting with 9 instances of class A and 1 instance of class B, successfully predicting 8 of the 9 instances of class A and none of class B yields an accuracy of 0.8 and a balanced accuracy of 0.44.

The binary classification setting was similar to the multiclass one.
The five tissues with the most studies (brain, blood, breast, stem cell, and cervix) were compared against each other pairwise.
The expression used in this setting was the set of samples labeled as one of the two tissues being compared.

The data for both settings were split in a stratified manner based on their study.

**GTEx classification**  
The multi-tissue classification analysis for GTEx used all 31 tissues.
The multiclass and binary settings were formulated and evaluated in the same way as in the Recount3 data.
However, rather than being split study-wise, the cross-validation splits were stratified according to the samples' donors.

**Simulated data classification/sex prediction**  
The sex prediction and simulated data classification tasks were solely binary.
Both settings used balanced accuracy, as in the Recount3 and GTEx problems.

**Pretraining**  
When testing the effects of pretraining on the different model types, we split the data into three sets.
Approximately forty percent of the data went into the pretraining set, forty percent went into the training set, and twenty percent went into the validation set.
The data was split such that each study's samples were in only one of the three sets to simulate the real-world scenario where a model is trained on publicly available data and then fine-tuned on a dataset of interest.

To ensure the results were comparable, we made two copies of each model with the same weight initialization.
The first copy was trained solely on the training data, while the second was trained on the pretraining data, then the training data.
Both models were then evaluated on the validation set.
This process was repeated four more times with different studies assigned to the pretraining, training, and validation sets.
