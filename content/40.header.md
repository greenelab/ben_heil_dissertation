# Chapter 4: MousiPLIER, the largest and most murine PLIER model ever trained

This chapter is from a manuscript in progress that is a collaboration between the Heller and Greene labs.

**Contributions**  
I am co-first author on the manuscript. 
I trained the MousiPLIER model, wrote and edited the manuscript, wrote code to make the results easier to use in Python, and ran the analyses leading to figures 9, 10, 12, and 15.
Shuo Zhang is the other co-first author on the manuscript.
He edited the manuscript, provided biological expertise useful in selecting latent variables and gene sets, and ran the analyses leading to figures 11, 13, and 14.
Wayne Mao provided guidance for training PLIER in a large dataset.
Casey S. Greene gave feedback and guidance on the experiments run, and is a co-corresponding author on the manuscript.
Elizabeth A. Heller edited the manuscript, gave feedback and guidance on the experiments run, and helped interpret enriched genes in MousiPLIER latent variables.
