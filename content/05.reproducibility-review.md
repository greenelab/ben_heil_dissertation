## Reproducibility intro

### What is computational reproducibility

We'll use the definition "the ability to recreate computational results from the data and code used by the original researcher" (http://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf)

### Why does it matter?
Oreskes why trust science: consensus is key to science being reliable [@isbn:9780691179001]

Excellent reproducibility for scientific computing review [@doi:10.1145/3186266]

Preclinical studies for drug development could be replicated in only 10-25% of cases [@doi:10.1038/483531a; @doi:10.1038/nrd3439-c1]

Similarly, only about 50% of ACM papers were able to be built from their source code (http://repeatability.cs.arizona.edu/v2/RepeatabilityTR.pdf)

Allows remixing (mention alphafold example)

Lack of reproducibility could cause a lack of trust in science [@doi:10.1177/1745691612465253]



### What can be done?

Document well, write code for ease of executability, and make code deterministic [@doi:10.1098/rsta.2020.0069]

Maybe we should create a central repository of data and code used in research like we have a repository for articles in PubMed Central [@doi:10.1126/science.1213847].
The field of machine learning has something similar in Papers with Code (https://paperswithcode.com/), a website where you can browse only the machine learning preprints and papers that have associated code.

Executable papers (CITE distil.pub, ELife)

In chapter X, we give our own recommendations for ways to make machine learning research in the life sciences reproducible.
