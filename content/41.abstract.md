## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Differential expression analysis is widely used to learn from gene expression data.
However, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality â€” RNA-sequencing experiments tends to have tens of thousands of genes with only tens or hundreds of samples.
Many unsupervised learning models are designed to reduce dimensionality, and the PLIER model in particular fits expression data well.
In this paper we describe the training of the Mouse MultiPLIER (MousiPLIER) model, the first PLIER model trained on a mouse compendium and the PLIER model with the most training samples.
We then go on to show that the model's latent variables contain biologically relevant information by finding enrichment for a striatally-associated latent variable in a mouse brain aging study and using the latent variable to uncover studies in the training data corresponding to mouse brain processes.
This new model can assist mouse researchers in understanding the biological processes involved in their study and finding other studies in which these processes are relevant.
